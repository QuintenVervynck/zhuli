# Zhu Li
As Zhu Li was once Varrick's assistant, she's now mine.

### Installation
First of all you clone her (get your own Zhu Li).

`git clone https://github.com/QuintenVervynck/zhuli.git`

Next, I recommend you set an alias.

`echo 'alias zhuli="bash /home/q/zhuli/main.bash"' >> ~/.bash_aliases`

Finally you need to initialize her.

`zhuli install zhuli-data`
